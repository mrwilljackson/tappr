# TAPPr Security Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to security practices and guidelines for the TAPPr application.

## Available Documentation

- [API Key Security Best Practices](./api-key-security.md) - Guidelines for securely handling API keys in client and server code

## Security Principles

The TAPPr application follows these core security principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Components have only the access they need
3. **Secure by Default**: Security is built in, not added on
4. **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is protected at rest and in transit

## Security Checklist

When developing new features or making changes to the TAPPr application, consider the following security aspects:

- [ ] API keys and secrets are not hardcoded or exposed in client-side code
- [ ] Sensitive data is not logged or exposed in error messages
- [ ] Input validation is performed on all user inputs
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checks are in place
- [ ] HTTPS is used for all communications
- [ ] Database queries are protected against injection attacks
- [ ] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protections are implemented
- [ ] Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protections are in place

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in the TAPPr application, please report it by sending an email to security@tappr.beer. Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.
