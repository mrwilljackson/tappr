## Example Input

```json
{
  "name": "New Brew",
  "style": "IPA",
  "abv": 5.5,
  "ibu": 40.5,
  "description": "Description of the brew",
  "brewDate": "2024-04-01",
  "kegLevel": 100,
  "brewUuid": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"
}
```

## Notes

- The `id` property is auto-generated and cannot be set manually.
- The `created_at` and `updated_at` properties are auto-generated and cannot be set manually.
- The `api_brew_uuid` is auto-generated by the API and serves as the unique immutable key for the record.
- If `brewUuid` is not provided, a new UUID will be generated for the companion app reference.
- If `brewDate` is not provided, the current date will be used.
- If `kegLevel` is not provided, it will default to 100 (full keg).
- The `ibu` field can store decimal values (e.g., 45.5) for more precise bitterness measurements.

## Database Mapping

The Brew model maps to the `brews` table in the database. The API uses camelCase property names, while the database uses snake_case column names:

| API Property | Database Column |
|--------------|------------------|
| id | id |
| name | name |
| style | style |
| abv | abv |
| ibu | ibu |
| description | description |
| brewDate | brew_date |
| kegLevel | keg_level |
| api_brew_uuid | api_brew_uuid |
| brewUuid | brew_uuid |
| createdAt | created_at |
| updatedAt | updated_at |
